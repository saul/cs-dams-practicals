# Lists the terms in which a CS module is assessed), by scraping a module
# descriptor webpage (e.g. https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/modules/dams.html)
# producing a table, for example:
#
#      | Autumn | Spring | Summer |
# ---------------------------------
# NUMA | n      | y      | y      |

# This scraper doesn't consider open assessments, and doesn't work for modules
# with more than one closed assessment. This is deliberate!
